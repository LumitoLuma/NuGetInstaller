# NuGet Installer
**Attention! This documentation is currently outdated, so there are steps that may vary with the real result**
## What is NuGet Installer
NuGet Installer is a command-line installer that installs the latest version of NuGet.exe into your system. You may notice while you use NuGet that you always need to move `NuGet.exe` file every time you want to use it. To solve this problem, I wrote this software, NuGet Installer, that installs NuGet.exe directly into C:\Windows folder, so you do not need to copy it every time you want to run it.

## Building source code
### Requirements
-   Visual Studio 2019 or Microsoft .NET Framework

### Procedure
1.  `git clone` or download this repository.

2.  Open `cmd.exe` (or Developer Command Prompt if you are using Visual Studio) in the folder you have extracted the files.

3.  Run:

    ```batch
    msbuild.exe NugetInstaller.sln /m /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform="Any CPU"
    ```

4.  Check `bin\Release` folder and enjoy Nuget Installer!
